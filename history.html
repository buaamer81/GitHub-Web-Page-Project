<h3>Explore the vibrant history and present of the Duwamish tribe — the original inhabitants of Seattle.</h3>

       <p2> The name “Duwamish” is an Anglo-Europeanized version of dxʷdəwʔabš, which translates in English to “people of the inside,” in reference to the tribe’s settlement along the area’s Duwamish, Cedar, and Black Rivers. With archaeological evidence suggesting habitation in the Duwamish watershed by humans as far back as 8,000 years ago, and Duwamish stories detailing events during the most recent ice age, the Duwamish have occupied the Puget Sound region for as long as history has been documented.</p2>
        <p>Born in 1780, Chief Si’ahl, for whom the city of Seattle is named, grew to become the most influential and historically renowned Duwamish chief. Si’ahl was recognized from a young age for his strength and fearlessness, and, as the child of a mother from the Duwamish tribe and a father from the Suquamish, grew to inherit a role as the chief of both tribes.</p>
        <p1>By the 1850s, Chief Si’ahl was celebrated more for his peaceful, diplomatic efforts rather than for his prowess in battle. When European immigrants arrived in the Americas in the mid-19th century, Si’ahl greeted them at Alki Point near Duwamish Head. The new European-American immigrants noted the efforts of Chief Si’ahl and the dxʷdəwʔabš in striving to live amicably alongside them. Si’ahl provided the immigrants with assistance and resources, such as lumber for canoes and dwellings; crops and agricultural labor; the teaching of survival skills; and collaboration in the creation of Henry Yesler’s first sawmill.</p1>
        <p>The Treaty of Point Elliott was signed in 1855 between the United States Government and various tribes of the Pacific Northwest outlining territorial rights between the parties. Shortly after the signing of the treaty, however, European immigrants backed out of the agreement. This led to an outbreak of war, even pitting some tribes against one another. In accordance with the treaty’s initial terms, the Duwamish had exchanged 54,000 acres of land for the promise of reservation along with hunting and fishing rights. These acres now comprise much of present-day King County, including the cities of Seattle, Bellevue, Mercer Island, and Tukwila. </p>
        <h3><center>Twentieth Century</center></h3>
        <p2>Prior to The Great Depression, development of the area accumulated a consistent pace, particularly in the logging and agricultural arenas. This reached a peak coinciding with the start of World War II, leading Seattle’s industrial regions to grow to new levels. Boeing built factories in Renton wetlands and along the Duwamish River, while the Pacific Car and Foundry Company (PACCAR) followed suit, expanding their own plant in the area.</p2>
        <p>The mid-20th century saw an increase of pollution in the Duwamish River, with the effects of municipal sewage and industrial chemical runoff becoming a notable concern. While attempts were made to mitigate this damage as early as the 1940s, it wasn’t until the 1958 establishment of the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (METRO) and its sewage treatment system that the river’s water quality began to improve. Development, however, continued to increase, and the Duwamish River became home to even more industrial and residential centers. The runoff of this development led to the river accumulating even more pollutants, harming its biodiversity and its role as a source of sustenance and veneration for the Duwamish and Muckleshoot peoples that it had been for thousands of years.</p>
        <p4>The benefits that these developments brought to non-Native newcomers came at a great expense to the region’s Indigenous communities. After the initial broken treaty arrangements were followed by displacement from traditional gathering areas and the disruption of local, significant ecosystems, the stability of the Duwamish and other Indigenous groups of the region was greatly affected during this period.</p4>
