<h3>Explore the vibrant history and present of the Duwamish tribe — the original inhabitants of Seattle.</h3>
<section id="Present">
        <h3><center>Present</center></h3>
        <p1>Today, the Duwamish tribe is still active, with Cecile Hansen — the great great grandniece of Chief Si’ahl — acting as its current chair. Despite the tribe’s longevity and history, the Duwamish are still not among the 29 Indigenous tribes of Washington State that receive federal recognition and ensuing benefits. Resulting from the broken arrangements of the 1855 Point Elliott Treaty, the tribe never received reservation protection. In an effort to compensate the Duwamish for the treaty’s transfer of land, 1,000 members of the tribe were each given $64 in 1971 — an amount that equates to only $64,000 for 54,000 acres of modern King County.</p>
        <p>Over the past several decades, without federal recognition the tribe has struggled to provide its 600 enrolled members with social, health, educational benefits, as well as with cultural programs. While the actual number of individuals with dxʷdəwʔabš ancestry is estimated to be higher, many choose instead to register among tribes that receive official recognition and benefit status through the U.S. government. </p>

    <h3><center>Duwamish Language<</center></h3>    
        <p>The Duwamish speak a language known as tʷəlšucid, or Lushootseed, which itself comprises two different dialects. In 2002, Zalmai “Zeke” Zahir became instated as head linguist of the Duwamish Language Program, which was established to revitalize the tʷəlšucid language for present generations.</p>    
        <h3><center>Duwamish Culture and Crafts</center></h3>   
        <p>As with most groups that have long-spanning ties with a geographical area, the Duwamish people have historically incorporated a lot of the surrounding environment into their daily lives and routines. Many Duwamish homes throughout the years have been located near bodies of water, which has played a central role in the tribe’s culture and traditions. Canoes became an integral part of life, and the Duwamish crafted numerous types to adapt to different uses, ranging between hunting, fishing, racing, and transportation. The waters and forests of the Pacific Northwest have provided many staples of the traditional Duwamish diet, including fish and waterfowl as well as game, root vegetables, and Pacific Northwest fruits. </p>    
            <p1>Weaving and carving play large roles in traditional Duwamish expression and handicraft, while oral history has also been a significant part of the Duwamish culture over the years, highlighting stories that incorporate aspects of generosity and compassion alongside an emphasis on health and hard work. The tribe has also incorporated much of the region’s abundant plant life into herbal medicines, affirming an importance placed on mental and physical well-being. Meanwhile, Duwamish potlatches are held to encourage tribal communication, celebrate important life events, and foster spiritual togetherness.</p1>
